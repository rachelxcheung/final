		<p id="story1"><i>EAST VILLAGE’S HEALTHY MARKET PLACE: A BODEGA'S HOPES ON BEATING GENTRIFICATION</i></p>

		<img id="bodega" src="bodega.jpg">

		<p>4:30 a.m. — Shahker Ahmed, a 54-year-old bodega owner, watches the sun rise as he commutes from Jersey City to the Manhattan for the morning shift. He arrives to the bodega, which sports a faded white awning and a dim, flickering LED sign. Although gentrification in the East Village is a force against Shahker’s business, the bodega, Healthy Market Place, has been in business for over thirteen years, and Shahker shares his gentrification “survival” experience. </p>

		<p>Shahker opened the bodega in May 2005, working with prep cooks, stock boys, and delivery workers to provide quality products and efficient service to New Yorkers. The year following Healthy Market Place’s opemning, <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170531/east-village/trader-joes-east-village-location-peter-stuyvesant-post-office/">Trader Joe’s opened in Union Square</a>. Then, <a href="http://evgrieve.com/2014/10/at-westside-market-opening-soon-on-3rd.html">Westside Market popped up on 3rd Avenue in 2014</a>. As if those corporate grocery stores and the several nearby bodegas wasn’t enough competition for Shahker, a <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2018/5/16/17360218/east-village-new-york-target-opening-date">Target appeared on Avenue A this past August</a>. It is common that businesses relocate or close due to competition and increased rent costs, but somehow, Healthy Market Place has remained part of the neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Wooden shelving units desperately cling onto the lime green walls of the bodega’s interior, the tiles and grout continue to brown regardless of how frequently they are met with a mop, and the large cash register clacks with loud, sticky keys. The bodega has held onto its original structure since first being built, and Shahker refuses to remodel anything he doesn’t need to. “I want this to be authentic,” he said, “I want people to walk in and think, ‘This is what a New York City corner store should be.’”</p>
		
		<p>The bodega is open 24/7, so Shahker’s first challenge is hiring employees who are willing to work early mornings and late nights. Shahker typically works six days a week, and his two sons, Amer and Hassim, work five shifts a week. Shahker says many employees are family friends and people who know the bodega through his sons, but it’s challenging to keep employees when other businesses can offer higher pay than his minimum wage offering. “It’s challenging when a big business come to the neighborhood. Customers leave me for businesses they know and employees leave me for more money,” Shahker said, “and it’s not easy to teach someone how to cook, clean, or maintain a business if they haven’t before.”</p>

		<img id="bodega2" src="bodega2.jpg">

		<p>With the recent opening of Target two blocks from the bodega, two of Shahker’s employees — a stock boy and a prep cook — found employment at Target for a hourly wage of $16 to Shahker’s $12. The stock boy, Dominic, returned to the bodega for occasional weekend shifts and still works at Target throughout the week. Following his return to employment at the bodega, Dominic said, “I need the money and I have the time, and honestly I prefer working at the bodega. It is a smaller team, and it feels more like family. I also miss seeing the same customers everyday.” </p>

		<p>Although Shahker wouldn’t disclose the bodega’s annual rent cost for privacy reasons, the <a href="https://www.rebny.com/content/dam/rebny/Documents/PDF/News/Research/Retail%20Reports/REBNY_Manhattan_Retail_Report_Spring_2018.pdf?">Real Estate Board of New York’s Spring 2018 Commercial Estate Report</a> reports that from Spring 2017 to Spring 2018, the average rent per square foot in the neighborhoods below 14th Street and above Houston decreased from $334 to $313. The bodega’s square footage is approximately 1100 feet according to Shahker, indicating at the yearly ground floor commercial rent cost is roughly $344,300.</p>

		<p>As of July 2018, the bodega is exempt from New York City’s Commercial Rent Tax (CRT) according to a <a href="http://bbwg.com/media/bbwg_may_v02.pdf">report by Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman</a>, a real estate law firm. The law states that small businesses will benefit by eliminating their CRT as a result of  “the increase in annual rent threshold for which the tax applies, providing for a sliding scale tax based upon income, and eliminating the tax completely for businesses that pay less than $500,000 in annual rent.” Because the bodega’s annual rent is less than $500,000, Shahker is exempt from paying CRT, which he says is a “major help.”</p>

		<p>Shahker says the cost of running his business is just manageable, but he thanks loyal customers for the bodega’s financial stability. “I have mostly young customers in their 20’s and in college… I have increased prices because I have to, but many of these customers choose to support me rather than a big chain, which I appreciate and need,” Shahker said. “It’s awareness… many young people see how quickly everything changes. They learn what ‘gentrification’ means when they are young, and even if they don’t know it, just buying a coffee is enough.”</p>

		<p>The bodega’s largest success factor is its community — those who believe in and support small businesses, helping New York maintain a sense of authenticity over aesthetic in this age of rapid gentrification. Shahker said, “I moved here from Turkey in 1992 to start a business and raise a family. I succeeded in both of those things, because there is a relationship here, between all of us. I need my family to help me and loyal customers to support me. I can’t do it all on my own.”</p>

		<p id="story2"><b>STORY TWO:</b></p>
		<p id="story2"><i>NYC GRAFFITI TOURS: TOURISM GENTRIFICATION</i></p>

		<p>Stroll down First Avenue, walk east once you hit Houston Street, and continue downtown through the Lower East Side. Turn your head left and right, tilt your line of vision upwards and down. This is what an hour and a half can be spent doing on a walking graffiti tour in Lower Manhattan.</p>

		<p>Graffiti signifies drawings and writing on a wall within public view, typically commenting on a particular social or political issue. Walking tours are abundant in New York City, but the tendencies of consumers of an experience of this particular nature raise skepticism towards the capitalization of graffiti, an artform that is intended for general public viewing. Although targeting tourists can lead to a successful business, when that demographic is met with an experience that is not intended for such consumption, a line of morality becomes clouded. By profiting off of simply walking and looking, graffiti tours both defy the purpose of the artform and perpetuate gentrification.</p>

		<img id="graffiti" src="graffiti.jpg">


		<p>A warm, heightened mural depicting a young girl with a dove perched on her fingertips on the side rests on a the side of a building in the East Village. Jonathan McNally, a 23-year-old New York City college student, artist, and tour guide for Graff Tours in Manhattan, points to the graffiti on the south side of 11th Street. “RISE ABOVE by Shepard Fairey. This piece is of Fairey’s daughter, intended to inspire people to look up, and offers a sense of hope and positivity,” he said. With its striking red and yellow sunray-esque strokes, this take on the artwork resonated with me. For other tour attendees, pulling out their smartphones to snap photos seemed more important.</p>

		<img id="graffiti2" src="graffiti2.jpg">

		<p>“Look at that store!”</p>
		<p>“Oh, let’s come back here to eat later.”</p>
		<p>“When are we done walking this thing?”</p>

		<p>The comments of tour attendees were perplexing to hear. Many didn’t seem to enjoy the tour, or voluntarily attend.</p>


		<p>The lack of attentiveness continued as the group marched downtown. Graff Tours offers a tour in downtown Manhattan for $15 for students, seniors, and kids, and $20 for adults. There are options for tours in Manhattan and Brooklyn, showcasing large murals and graffiti tags to tourist groups of 25 people five times a day, equating to an approximate annual profit of $820,000.</p>

		<img id="graffiti3" src="graffiti3.jpg">

		<p>As new restaurants and glamorous boutiques pop up almost overnight, gentrification continues to traverse New York City neighborhoods. According to Ann Larkin, a Business Coordinator at Graff Tours, the company’s average monthly revenue for is $67,500. “Depending on the time of year and political and  social climates, Graff Tours will donate 10% of ticket proceeds to a local New York City charity,” Larkin said. Citing company privacy rules, Larkin did not disclose the names of past charities or donation amounts, although the Graff Tours website showcases a collaboration in December 2016 with Wendy’s fast food chain and their H.S Heisman Program in which 50 scholarship finalists and their parents were taught graffiti techniques.</p>

		<p>For McNally, graffiti as an art form has a “major cultural relevance.” Growing up in Brooklyn Heights into an adopted white family, McNally spent his youth exploring various neighborhoods in the city. McNally identifies as black despite his white upbringing, and recalled graffiti as a cultural pastime. “In middle school, the Lower East Side was not what it is now. My parents didn’t want me hanging around there, but I went to graffiti with my friends anyways. It made me feel connected to black culture.”</p>


		<p>People look to neighborhoods like Bushwick as “meccas” for graffiti without recognizing the larger effects on the displacement of locals, shifting favor towards young outsiders who can afford higher rents. Graffiti has become a symbol of urban coolness despite how the medium itself and those who practice it are routinely criminalized. According to Sidd Joag, a New York-based visual artist, community organizer, and journalist, “Graffiti is arguably the most relevant art form of our time, yet it is attacked, destroyed, and routinely commodified in the service of gentrification.”</p>

		<p>By marketing an experience that is intended in its artistic nature for public consumption, Graff Tours is profiting off of graffiti culture. Artists Shepard Fairey, Ron English, Gilf, and Claw Money do not earn any profits, and no concrete evidence exists towards Graff Tours’ claims that donations have been made to local charities. Capitalizing off the glamorization of graffiti without regard to its cultural significance ultimately perpetuates gentrification. “Not only do I wish the money made from these tours went to the artists or other artistic institutions, but I wish people took the time to learn the history and significance of graffiti,” McNally said. “It’s not just spray paint on a wall, it’s artwork with a complex culture and story.”</p>

		<p id="story3"><b>STORY THREE:</b></p>
		<p id="story3"><i>NYC'S NEW AESTHETIC: GENTRIFICATION</i></p>

		<p>Clean, smooth marble. An accent color, maybe two. Plants — everywhere. Bonus points for a neon sign. This is the restaurant aesthetic that is not only increasingly prevalent on social media feeds, but also contributes towards the gentrification movement across New York City.</p>

		<p>Urban environments have consistently been a mecca for beautiful and expensive restaurants, but in recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in how this minimalist aesthetic attracts young people and tourists to certain neighborhoods. By branding themselves with a modern visual appeal, these restaurants become photo destinations, reeling in tourists and young adults through social media. There seems to be a higher interest for indulging in aesthetically pleasing goods over acknowledging how our actions affect gentrification in a community, ultimately raising skepticism towards social efforts to consume more consciously. </p>

		<img id="food" src="milk.jpg">

		<p>Consider Milk Bar and Mimi Cheng’s in the East Village — two picturesque environments and overpriced cuisine for its worth under the guise of sustainability.</p>

		<img id="food2" src="milk2.jpg">

		<p>Fully equipped with a pink neon sign and pop culture references, you can expect to find a line of customers wrapped around the northwest corner of East 13th Street and 1st Avenue on any given weekend night. Milk Bar is one of the most popular New York dessert destinations, featured on publications like The New York Times, Eater, and Bloomberg. Milk Bar’s yearly profit for singular items is shocking; according to Bloomberg, the most popular item is the sprinkle-laced cake truffle. Last year the company sold more than 600,000 dozens of them at $16 per dozen, equating to $9,600,000. Another popular item is the compost cookie, 300,000 of which were sold at $3.65 a piece in 2015 for a total of $1,095,000. Milk Bar’s volumes of sales offsets the cost of ingredients.</p>

		<p>According to Kelsey Labbe, an employee at Milk Bar since May 2016, the recent decade anniversary of the location has marked a shift in how Milk Bar feels part of the community. Although they have been established for a decade and are familiar with their neighbors, a chalkboard sign still bears notice to be respectful of nearby residents. “Our parent restaurant, Momofuku Ssam Bar, is right across the street. We’ve known our neighbors for years, and try to be respectful of their homes.” Labbe’s coworker, 26-year-old Jonathan Wiley, responded with a chuckle. “We try to be respectful, yeah, but the customers don’t always listen to what we say. Last month I had to tell a group of 13 young tourists to move three times, but they kept saying they just wanted to get a perfect photo,” Wiley said. </p>

		<p>“I’ve lived on this block for about 30 years,” 59-year-old Jonas Murray-Golod said, “The crowds in front of my house are loud because they’re tourists, or loud and intoxicated because they’re young. Then they move into the neighborhood and kick out everyone who has lived here for longer than they’ve been alive.”</p>

		<p>Just a few blocks south of Milk Bar, a similar dilemma exists at Mimi Cheng’s on 2nd Avenue, a dumpling restaurant with a similar modern aesthetic. Strategically decorated with a Tiffany blue accent throughout a primarily white-furnished restaurant, bright yellow stools, and scattered plants, Mimi Cheng’s is branded in a similar visually pleasing fashion. A plate of eight dumplings costs $10, which is not expensive on the surface, but considering the mass quantities of dumplings produced by the ingredients purchased in bulk, Mimi Cheng’s is profiting tremendously off of a simple dish.</p>

		<img id="food4" src="mimichengs2.jpg">

		<p>Although Mimi Cheng’s is not crowding the sidewalk with lines of customers at the same volume as Milk Bar, there is still a noticeable demographic and habit of their customers. Gloria Antonia Garcia is a prep cook for Mimi Cheng’s, having worked at this location for two years. As a native-born New Yorker, Garcia has observed gentrification throughout the neighborhoods. “I see 90 percent of customers take photos of their food, which is great for business. But we attract very similar types of people, like college students who live in the area. And tourists. Many, many, many tourists,” Garcia said. </p>

		<img id="food3" src="mimichengs.jpg">


		<p>The sister duo that started Mimi Cheng’s chose the neighborhood because “the East Village is always on the cutting edge of niche food,” said one of the founders Hannah Cheng in an interview with The Village Voice, “There is heavy demand for modernized, sustainable cuisine at cheaper prices in this neighborhood.”</p>

		<p>The primary contributing factor to this demand is the influx of young adults moving into the neighborhoods, pushing out locals and replacing old businesses with shinier, prettier, more “ethical” ones. According to the New York City Community District Profile Census in 2014, the highest age range of residents in the East Village is reported as 25 to 29 years old, followed by the second highest range of 20 to 24 years old.</p>

		<p>With Milk Bar’s compost cookie comprised entirely of recycled ingredients and Mimi Cheng’s organically sourced meat and produce, even their menu items seem to be capitalizing off the guise of sustainability. Although the intention of restaurants who choose to brand themselves in this minimalistic fashion is probably not to further the gentrification issue in the East Village, it’s an issue that is becoming increasingly prevalent.</p>

		<p>But it’s not just Milk Bar and Mimi Cheng’s which echo the effects of aesthetically pleasing businesses on a neighborhood’s gentrification. There was the recent replacement of Zucker Bakery in July 2018 — a Jewish-owned family business on 9th Street — by Westville Bakery, an extension of Westville, a brunch restaurant just two blocks away. Tu-Lu’s Gluten Free Bakery on 11th Street opened in 2010, competing with next-door neighbor Veniero’s, a family-owned Italian dessert spot that has been in the East Village since 1894. Plant Made and PureGreen, two businesses that are framed by the mantra “healthy eats,” collaborated in a space on 2nd Avenue this past March, replacing the kitchen of a small Yiddish butcher’s shop.</p>

		<p>In an ever-changing city like New York, it becomes increasingly difficult to notice the weight of what an individual’s consumption does on a larger scale. In an effort to preserve the culture and history of a neighborhood, an awareness towards businesses marketing tactics like following popular aesthetics and sustainability trends needs to be made. Rather than consuming what we enjoy looking at, taking photos of, and spreading as eco-friendly, it is equally significant to consider the weight of what we consume and how our actions affect a community at large.</p>
